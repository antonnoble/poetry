O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruin of the blah blah blah
Who ever lived in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths to ope their ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
